# Arduino-powered Smart Gardening Solution, to automate plant care and optimize growth conditions. Integrated sensors for soil moisture, light levels, and rain detection to intelligently control watering and alert users about plant status. Utilized actuators and LED indicators for automated irrigation and feedback. This project demonstrated my proficiency in IoT, sensor integration, and independent project development, contributing to sustainable and efficient gardening practices.
# To a certain degree, utilizing financial resources, we can further illustrate how this project can be extended to protect and nurture crops in agricultural fields, thereby preventing further damage to crops and plants.
